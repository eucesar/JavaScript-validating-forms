# JavaScript-validating-forms
I learned how to apply form validation attributes with HTML5. I built validations for the CPF check digits. Implemented majority validations from date comparison. I customized error messages for each form field type. I integrated the user's webcam into a browser screen. Captured photos via webcam. I saved and edit saved data in the browser.
